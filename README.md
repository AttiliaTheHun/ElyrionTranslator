# ElyrionTranslator
Elyrion translator is a tool that translates your text into Elyrion text.
## Versions
There are currently two version: Android and Desktop. Desktop version is in Java, which makes it more or less cross-platform.
## Features
### Android
- translate between alphabets: English (latin) x Elyrion
### Desktop
- translate between alphabets: English (latin) x Elyrion
- TODO: translate known words in the Elyrion language
## How does it work
### Transliteration (alphabet translation)
Elyrion alphabet is publicly available on [Polytopia discord server](https://discord.gg/polytopia), so the translator just replaces the letter with it's equivalent in the second alphabet
### Translation (word translation)
On [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gr0nh7tLPXuHs402-tE9tV_ecVb41-OXdGG62ZFGUF8/edit#) is a list of known words in the Elyrion language, compiled by comparing Elyrion and English translations of the game. I have made a dictionary file (stay chill, it is just a `.txt`) and the translator does the same replacing, only on words instead of letters. This may lead to some imprecise translation as there is no AI trying to catch the context. However the language is currently not explored very much and we don't know many words, so I think it is gona be ok for now.
